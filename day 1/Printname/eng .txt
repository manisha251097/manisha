my grievence is my boss is treating me by unfair means
First i have seen the change in her behaviour when i informed her 
about my pregnacy sometime in late october
i uasualyy do work from home on fridays since i get tired commutating from far off place
on 2 January my boss said that I would have to work in the office every day of the week until I went on maternity leave. When I asked why, 
she just said she needed staff in the office
she rudely spoke to me asking me to leave if i have any problem coming to office on fridays
i have my collegues who have witnessed the whole incident as a proof
I have discussed it with the managers but the  outcome wasnt satisfactory
im being singled out..it isnt a general behaviour
Even few of my collegues are supporting her.
i m still on my leave till 13th this month.
mam i have worked day and night for the well being of the company
i think my reviw is done by my boss and i think they would have been biased
i want u to take action immeadiating on this issue.
i want a day of the week to be work from home so that it would be better considering  my pregnancy
